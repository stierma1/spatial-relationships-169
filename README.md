# spatial-relationships-169
Gives back the spatial relationship operators given 2 ribbons(ie squares)
There are a total of 169 different relationships that can exist between 2 squares each
relationship can be encoded as a sequence of 4 characters, 2 chars for the operators and 2 chars for the symmetry indicator, since most(all except equals) have a mirror symmetric version.

# Categories
These 169 relationships can be placed into 5 categories

1.Disjoint
2.Joint
3.Partial Overlap
4.Contained
5.Belonging

These can be categorized easily with the relationship string Lee and Hsu came up with.
The strings only need to be checked for 5 rules plus a default in order to properly categorize the squares.
